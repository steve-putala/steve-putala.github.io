How to install Composer on Ubuntu using apt. This results in an old version of Composer.

## From https://getcomposer.org

Follow the instructions here: <https://getcomposer.org/download/>

```php
php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
php -r "if (hash_file('sha384', 'composer-setup.php') === '55ce33d7678c5a611085589f1f3ddf8b3c52d662cd01d4ba75c0ee0459970c2200a51f492d557530c71c15d8dba01eae') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
php composer-setup.php --install-dir=/usr/local/bin
php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```

## Debian/Ubuntu apt install, which will likely be an outdated version of Composer

```shell
sudo apt install composer
```
